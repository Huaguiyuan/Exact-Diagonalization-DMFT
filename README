! DESCRIPTION
! This code solve an impurity problem by mean of complete 
! Exact Diagonalization. For any given bath+impurity hami-
! ltionian, the code evaluate the spectrum of the problem, 
! the impurity Green`s functions, some observables and op-
! tionally the spin susceptibility.
! The bath hamiltionian is generated from scratch the first 
! call to the main routine. If the file `Hfile` is found, 
! the hamiltonian is read from it. Alternatively, if `Hfile` 
! is not found but `Dfile` exists, the bath hybridization 
! Delta function is read from it and the hamiltionian is 
! generated thru a conjgate gradient fit, similar to that 
! used to implement the self-consistency condition.
! The self-consistency (the cg-fit) must be provided by the 
! user (reverse communication) as well as the calculation 
! of the Delta function. The former can be performed using 
! the routines supplied with this code. A different user-
! defined method can also be used.
